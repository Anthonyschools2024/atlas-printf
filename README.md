In this project we will be working with a teammate 
to recreate the printf function. WE must create a workflow chart 
that will guide us in writing the code that will creat teh function "printf".
We must recreate the function and then in our own words craete a man page
explaining how our version printf works.Once all task are completed by the due date 
we will be presenting our versions of printf to the 
entire class. Thank you for taking the time to reading my readme, I  hope you find it informative 
and guides you throughh the project.
